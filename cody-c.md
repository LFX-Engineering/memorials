I first met Cody when he was at Crossvale back in 2015.  We spoke at length about how containers were going to change computing, and we discovered a shared passion for both effective communication about technology, and open source being the best way to share these innovations.  He and I kept in touch over the years, and I finally got to work with him throughout 2022 in a more direct fashion.

He had such tenacity, passion, and friendliness as he went about everything he did.  He was so welcoming, but also made sure to make time for his family.  As we worked from home, Cyrus would join our video sessions on occasion - he always acted embarrassed, but I thought it was really sweet and only made him a better father.  He would always check in with the kids while he traveled to our work events.

It's only been a few days and I already miss him dearly.  Cody - RIP my dude.
