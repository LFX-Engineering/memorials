I had the honor of working with Shubhra on a variety of LFX initiatives and projects.

I admired his passion in all his work and sense of committment to the LF and open source community.

Also, I respected him so much for his drive and support of his team, growing them and taking care of them, even across organizations.

You will be missed, rest in peace.
