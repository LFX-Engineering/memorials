I had the honor of working with Shubhra on a variety of LFX initiatives and projects.

I admired his passion in all his work and sense of committment to the LF and open source community.

Also, I respected him so much for his drive and support of his team, growing them and taking care of them, even across organizations.

You will be missed, rest in peace.

Shubra brought so much positivity, energy and optimism to his work at the Linux Foundation. His excitement and pride over the team's work was palpable and absolutely justified - the team has built a powerful platform to support the open source community. 

I'm so grateful for Shubra's leadership, positive energy and friendship he brought to the LF and everyone around him.

You will be dearly missed, Shubra, but your legacy will live on at the LF and beyond.
